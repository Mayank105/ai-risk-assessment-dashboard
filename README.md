AI-Powered Security Risk Assessment Dashboard  
🚀 A cybersecurity tool that analyzes system configurations, detects vulnerabilities and predicts risk levels using AI.  

🌟 Features  
✅ AI-Powered Risk Analysis – TensorFlow.js neural network for risk prediction.  
✅ Real-Time Security Evaluation – Checks firewall, encryption, admin accounts, and vulnerabilities.  
✅ Multi-Format Support – Upload security configurations in CSV, JSON, or YAML.  
✅ Dynamic Risk Visualization – Interactive charts with Chart.js.  
✅ Automated Reports – Generate PDF & JSON security reports.  

How It Works  
1️⃣ Upload Security Configuration Files – The system accepts **CSV, JSON, and YAML** files containing security settings.  
2️⃣ Risk Analysis Begins – The AI model and rule-based scoring system analyze firewall status, admin accounts, vulnerabilities, and encryption.  
3️⃣ Risk Score Calculation – A **combined AI and static risk scoring system** assigns a **risk score (0-100)** and categorizes it as **Low, Medium, High, or Critical**.  
4️⃣ Real-Time Visualization – The dashboard displays risk levels with an **interactive Chart.js graph**.  
5️⃣ Download Security Report – Users can **export the results as a JSON or PDF file** for security auditing.  

🔧 Technologies Used
